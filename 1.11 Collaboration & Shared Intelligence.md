# **1.11 Collaboration & Shared Intelligence**

This is where your tool quietly becomes **a team brain**.

---

## 🎯 Core Goal

Turn isolated SQL work into **institutional knowledge**.

---

## 🔹 1.11.1 Shared Models & Views

From 1.8:

* Share ERDs
* Share model layers
* Share business definitions

This eliminates:

* “Which table should I use?”
* “What does this column mean?”

---

## 🔹 1.11.2 Query Sharing With Context

Queries should carry:

* Description
* Intent
* Owner
* Tags
* Performance notes

Not just blobs of SQL.

---

## 🔹 1.11.3 Inline Collaboration

Optional but powerful:

* Comments on queries
* Notes on tables/columns
* Warnings left by teammates

Example:

> “⚠️ This table double-counts historical rows pre-2022”

That’s gold.

---

## 🔹 1.11.4 Organizational Memory

Over time the system learns:

* Which joins are safe
* Which queries are canonical
* Which tables are deprecated-but-still-used

This is **tribal knowledge capture**, automated.

---

## 🔹 1.11.5 Exportable Knowledge

Everything should be exportable:

* Markdown docs
* ERDs
* Query catalogs
* Onboarding guides

Your GUI doubles as **documentation engine**.
