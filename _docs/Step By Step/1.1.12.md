## Step 1.1.12 — Data Entry v1 (Relational CRUD + FK Awareness) (exact)

Goal: allow **safe, schema-aware data editing** directly from ERD context.

---

# 1.1.12a) Data grid

Features:
- SELECT * with LIMIT/OFFSET
- Default sort by PK
- Inline filter (single column v1)
- Read-only by default

---

# 1.1.12b) Record form

Rules:
- NOT NULL enforced
- Defaults applied
- Parameterized queries only

Actions:
- Insert
- Update
- Delete (confirm required)

---

# 1.1.12c) Relationship panels

Inbound FKs:
- Show child records in tabs
- “Add child” auto-fills FK

Outbound FKs:
- Dropdown selector
- Searchable
- Label rule:
  1) configured display column
  2) first text column
  3) PK fallback

---

# 1.1.12d) Safety controls

- Read-only toggle per workspace
- Disable delete in prod by default
- Optional soft-delete mapping

---

# Done criteria for 1.1.12

✅ Data grid loads from snapshot-aware queries  
✅ Forms enforce schema constraints  
✅ FK selectors are usable on large tables  
✅ Safety controls prevent accidental damage
