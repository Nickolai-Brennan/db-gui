Got it — continuing the outline. Here’s **1.8** 👇

## **1.8 Visual Modeling, ERDs & “Human-Friendly” Abstractions**

This is where your SQL GUI stops being *another DBeaver clone* and becomes **a modeling-first system**.

### 🎯 Core Goal

Reduce **cognitive load** for users by translating raw database structure into **clear, visual, explorable models**—without hiding SQL power.

---

### 🔹 1.8.1 Auto-Generated ERDs (But Smarter)

Most tools do this *badly*. Yours should:

* Auto-generate ERDs from:

  * Foreign keys
  * Inferred relationships (naming patterns, ID matching)
* Allow **manual overrides**
* Support **multiple diagram modes**:

  * Logical model (entities & relationships)
  * Physical model (tables, indexes, constraints)
  * Business model (renamed entities, aliases, grouped concepts)

Key differentiator:

> ERDs should be **editable objects**, not static diagrams.

---

### 🔹 1.8.2 Model Layers (This Is Big)

Introduce **Model Layers** on top of raw schemas:

* **Raw Layer**

  * Exact DB reflection
* **User Model Layer**

  * Renamed tables/columns
  * Virtual groupings (e.g. “Player Core Stats”)
* **Project Model Layer**

  * Saved views per project/app
  * Shareable models across teams

Think:

> dbt-style semantics + BI modeling + IDE ergonomics

---

### 🔹 1.8.3 Visual Query Builder (No Training Wheels)

Not “drag-and-drop for beginners”—instead:

* Visual joins with live SQL preview
* Toggle between:

  * Diagram mode
  * SQL editor
* Highlight:

  * Join paths
  * Cardinality warnings
  * Fan-out explosions

Power move:

> Every visual action = deterministic SQL output
> SQL is always first-class, never hidden

---

### 🔹 1.8.4 Relationship Intelligence

Add **relationship scoring**:

* FK confidence
* Usage frequency
* Join cost estimates
* Data volume impact

This enables:

* “Suggested joins”
* Warnings before expensive queries
* Smarter ERD auto-layouts

---

### 🔹 1.8.5 Domain-Specific Modeling (Your Secret Weapon)

Let users define **domain templates**:

* Sports analytics
* Finance
* SaaS events
* E-commerce

Each template:

* Naming conventions
* Common dimensions/facts
* Default visual groupings

This aligns *perfectly* with what you’ve been doing across stats-heavy systems.

---

### 🔹 1.8.6 Model Versioning & Diffing

Treat models like code:

* Version history
* Visual diffs
* Rollbacks
* Environment comparisons (dev vs prod)

Think Git — but for database *meaning*, not just schema.

---

### 🔹 1.8.7 Export & Interop

Models should export to:

* dbt YAML
* GraphQL schemas
* OpenAPI specs
* Markdown docs
* PNG/SVG diagrams

This turns your GUI into:

> A **source of truth generator**, not just a client

---

### Why 1.8 Matters

This section is what lets you say:

* “We’re not a SQL client”
* “We’re a **database intelligence workspace**”

If you want, next we can:

* Continue with **1.9 Performance & Query Intelligence**
* Or zoom in and turn **1.8 into a full product spec**
* Or map **1.8 → MVP vs v2 vs v3**

Just say where you want to go.
