Perfect — staying in flow.
Let’s keep the momentum and lock in the rest of **Section 1**, then I’ll naturally roll us into the **MVP cut line** so this doesn’t stay theoretical.

# **1.10 Security, Access Control & Guardrails**

This section answers the question every serious org will ask *immediately*:

> “How do we stop someone from nuking prod at 2am?”

---

## 🎯 Core Goal

Provide **surgical control** without slowing experts down.

Security should feel:

* Invisible when you’re doing the right thing
* Loud when you’re about to do something dumb

---

## 🔹 1.10.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC++)

Not just:

* Admin
* User
* Read-only

But **capability-based permissions**:

* Can run `SELECT`
* Can run `UPDATE/DELETE`
* Can alter schema
* Can create indexes
* Can run queries over X cost / rows

Permissions stack with:

* Role
* Environment (dev / staging / prod)
* Query intent (from 1.9)

---

## 🔹 1.10.2 Environment Awareness (Non-Negotiable)

The UI should **scream** when you’re in prod:

* Color-coded environments
* Watermarks
* Forced confirmations for destructive actions

Bonus:

* “Shadow mode” → preview prod queries without execution

---

## 🔹 1.10.3 Guardrails, Not Hard Stops

Instead of:

> “You can’t do that.”

Prefer:

* Soft warnings
* Required acknowledgements
* Peer approval gates (optional)

Examples:

* DELETE without WHERE → requires confirmation
* Schema changes → approval required
* Cost over threshold → blocked unless override role

---

## 🔹 1.10.4 Query Sandboxing

For exploratory work:

* Automatic LIMIT injection
* Sampled data execution
* Timeboxed queries

This protects:

* Warehouses
* Wallets
* Sleep schedules

---

## 🔹 1.10.5 Audit Logs (That Don’t Suck)

Track:

* Who ran what
* Against which DB
* With what cost
* What changed

But present it:

* Visually
* Searchable
* Diffable

Think:

> Git history + Cloud audit logs, minus the pain
