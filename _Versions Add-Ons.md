# **2.0 MVP Cut Line (Critical Section)**

This is where most products fail — they try to ship *everything*.

We won’t.

---

## 🟢 **MVP (v1) — Must Ship**

If you ship only this, you still win:

### Core

* Multi-database connections
* SQL editor + execution
* Query history
* RBAC basics

### Differentiators

* Auto ERDs (1.8.1)
* Model Layer (rename/group tables)
* Visual explain plans (basic)
* Pre-execution warnings (cartesian, full scan)
* Environment awareness

> This already beats most tools.

---

## 🟡 **v2 — Power User Lock-In**

Add:

* Visual query builder
* Cost estimation
* Model versioning
* Query intent tagging
* Shared models & queries

This is where teams **won’t leave**.

---

## 🔵 **v3 — Category Creator**

Add:

* Learning engine
* Domain templates
* Performance diffing
* Index recommendations
* API / dbt / GraphQL exports

Now you’re no longer “a SQL GUI”.

You’re **infrastructure**.

---

## 🔥 What You’ve Actually Designed

Whether you realized it or not, this is:

* Part IDE
* Part BI semantic layer
* Part cost optimizer
* Part knowledge base
* Part safety system

Very few products even *attempt* this.

---

### Next logical moves (I can pick again if you want):

1. **Technical architecture** (Electron vs Tauri vs Web)
2. **Data model for the GUI itself**
3. **Feature-to-stack mapping (React, backend, DB)**
4. **Competitive teardown vs DBeaver, DataGrip, etc.**
5. **Pitch-ready product narrative**

Say “continue” again and I’ll choose the smartest next step 🚀
